# Pathagram
A web platform for teaching advanced javascript and image processing. Created by the DLP Tech team for DLP Pathfinders.

## Development
Start by cloning the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DigitalLiteracyProject/pathagram.git`

To start the server, cd into the pathagram folder and run `sails lift`. The server will run at `localhost:1337`.

To work with the frontend code, edit the HTML in the `.ejs` files in the `/views` folder and the assets in the `/assets/js` and `/assets/css` folders.

To change routes, refer to the `/config/routes.js` file. Remember to restart the server any time you update the backend code for it to come into effect.
